# FAKE-ANIME-FACES-USING-DCGAN
ðŸŽ¨ Generating Anime Faces with DCGANs ðŸŽ¨

I recently built a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) that generates high-quality AI-generated anime faces from scratch. This project explores the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in synthesizing realistic images, specifically focusing on anime-style faces.

ðŸ”¹ How It Works:
âœ… Dataset â€“ Trained on a large collection of anime face images.
âœ… Generator â€“ A deep convolutional neural network that learns to generate realis
